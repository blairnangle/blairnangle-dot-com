***Write a short story about panyard in the style of C. S. Lewis***

Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled in the hills of a far off land. The village was known as Panyard, and it was a place of peace and tranquility.

The people of Panyard were a hardworking and humble folk, and they lived off the land. They grew crops, raised animals, and made their own clothes. The village was surrounded by lush green forests, and the people of Panyard were content with their simple lives.

One day, a stranger arrived in the village. He was a tall, imposing figure with a long white beard and piercing blue eyes. He wore a long, dark cloak and carried a strange instrument in his hands.

The stranger introduced himself as a traveling musician, and he said he was looking for a place to stay. The people of Panyard welcomed him with open arms, and the stranger was soon a part of the village.

Every night, the stranger would take out his instrument and play a beautiful melody. The music filled the air, and the people of Panyard soon found themselves in a trance. They would gather around the stranger, mesmerized by his music.

The stranger stayed in the village for many years, and he became a beloved member of the community. He taught the people of Panyard how to play his instrument, and they would often gather around him to listen to his stories.

The stranger eventually left the village, but the people of Panyard never forgot him. They still gather around the panyard to listen to the music of the stranger, and they remember him fondly.

The stranger may have left, but his music still lives on in the hearts of the people of Panyard.
