***Write a short story about boul in the style of C. S. Lewis***

Once upon a time, there lived a young boy named Boul. He was a curious and adventurous little boy, and his parents were very proud of him.

Boul lived in an old house near a mysterious forest. He often spent time exploring its vast expanse of trees and creatures. But, his favorite pastime was to search out the old, forgotten paths that wound through the forest.

One day, while exploring the woods, Boul stumbled upon a strange clearing. In the center of the clearing was a small, white cottage. Boul could have sworn that he'd never seen the cottage before, but he was curious and decided to risk a closer look.

Boul crept forward, but stopped when he noticed an old man, sitting on the steps of the cottage. The old man had a long, white beard and wore a white, hooded cloak. He was quietly singing a strange, yet beautiful, song.

Boul was suddenly overcome with a feeling of familiarity towards the old man and asked him if he knew him. The man smiled and replied, "Yes, I know you Boul. I am the keeper of these woods, and I have been watching you for quite some time. I know that you are brave and curious, and I believe you are the one who will bring peace to this land."

Boul was intrigued by the old man's words, but he wasn't sure what he could do. The old man then told Boul that he must go and find the four magical stones hidden in the depths of the forest and bring them back to the clearing. If he did this, peace would return to the land.

Boul accepted the challenge and set out to find the stones. He searched the dark corners of the forest and the secret passages of the trees for many days, but he never found the stones. Finally, one night, as he lay down to sleep, Boul heard a voice, gentle and wise, that said, "The stones are within you, Boul. You just have to learn to see them."

The next morning, Boul awoke with a newfound understanding. He realized that the stones symbolized courage, compassion, love, and understanding, and he knew he had to journey within himself to find them.

When he returned to the clearing with the four magical stones, the old man thanked Boul and said, "You have done a great service, Boul. Now, with these stones, peace will be restored to this land."

Boul smiled and thanked the old man before heading back home to tell his family of the magical adventure he had just experienced. From then on, whenever Boul needed a reminder of the power and strength within himself, he would look at the four stones and be reminded to persevere and never give up.
