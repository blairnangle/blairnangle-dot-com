***Write a short story about fioriture in the style of C. S. Lewis***

Once upon a time, there lived a young girl named Fioriture. She was a kind and gentle soul, with a love of nature and a deep appreciation for the beauty of the world around her.

Fioriture had a special gift, one that she kept hidden from the world. She could make flowers bloom with just a touch of her hand. Whenever she touched a flower, it would instantly blossom into a vibrant and colorful display of beauty.

One day, Fioriture was walking through a meadow when she noticed a single, wilted flower. She felt a deep sadness for the flower and decided to use her gift to help it. She touched the flower and it instantly bloomed into a magnificent display of color.

The sight of the flower filled Fioriture with joy and she decided to use her gift to help other flowers in need. She went from meadow to meadow, helping flowers to bloom and bringing joy to all who saw them.

Fioriture's gift was a blessing to the world, and soon people began to take notice. Word of her gift spread and soon she was known as the "Flower Fairy" all throughout the land.

Fioriture was content with her life, and she enjoyed helping the flowers to bloom. She knew that her gift was special and she was proud to share it with the world.

The end.
