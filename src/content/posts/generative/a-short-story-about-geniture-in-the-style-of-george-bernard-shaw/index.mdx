***Write a short story about geniture in the style of George Bernard Shaw***

Once upon a time, there was a young man named George who was determined to make something of himself. He had grown up in a small village and had never had the opportunity to explore the world beyond his little village.

One day, George heard about a new practice called geniture. It was a form of divination that used the position of the stars and planets at the time of someone's birth to predict their future.

George was intrigued by this practice and decided to give it a try. He visited a local astrologer and asked him to cast his birth chart. After studying the chart, the astrologer told George that he had a bright future ahead of him and that he should pursue his dreams.

Encouraged by the astrologer's words, George set off on a journey to make his dreams come true. He worked hard and eventually achieved success. He was able to provide a better life for himself and his family.

George never forgot the astrologer's words and was thankful for the guidance he had received. He believed that geniture had helped him to unlock his potential and make his dreams come true.

George's story is a testament to the power of geniture and the importance of following one's dreams. It is a reminder that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.
