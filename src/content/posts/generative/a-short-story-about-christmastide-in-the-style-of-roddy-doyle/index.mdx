***Write a short story about Christmastide in the style of Roddy Doyle***

It was Christmastide in Dublin, and the city was alive with the sounds of cheer. The streets were adorned with colorful lights, and people were singing carols and exchanging gifts.

Sean and his family were getting ready for the big day. They had been planning for weeks, putting up decorations and baking treats. Everyone was excited for the festivities to begin.

On Christmas morning, Sean and his family gathered around the tree to exchange gifts. His parents had bought him a new pair of running shoes and some art supplies, and his sister had made him a beautiful card with a little poem inside.

After the gift giving, Sean and his family went out to take a stroll around the city. They stopped at a small café to grab some hot chocolate. As they walked, they admired the decorations and homemade snowmen.

The day was perfect, until they noticed that one of the snowmen was missing. They searched the streets looking for it, and eventually found it in a nearby park. It had been vandalised and was in pieces.

Sean and his family were heartbroken. They knew how much joy and happiness the snowman had brought to their city.

To show appreciation for all the people in Dublin who had come together to make their city beautiful, Sean and his family decided to put the snowman back together. They worked together and soon had the snowman up and running.

Seeing their snowman restored to its former glory, Sean and his family felt immense joy and happiness. It was a reminder of the beauty of the season, and the importance of coming together as a community.

That night, Sean and his family went to bed with a smile on their faces. It had been a wonderful Christmastide, and one they would never forget.
