***Write a downbeat blog post about Broken Arrow, Oklahoma in complete sentences***

Living in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma is a grueling hardship. This small rural city doesn't offer much to its inhabitants. Most of the attractions in town are quite dated and lackluster. The shopping centers are overly crowded and expensive, with little variation in the stores. The nightlife is virtually nonexistent, making social activities hard to come by. There are few opportunities for employment, and the cost of living is exorbitantly high. The locals don't seem particularly friendly or inviting to outsiders, and it's hard to make connections with people here. Unfortunately, Broken Arrow is not the ideal place to call home.
