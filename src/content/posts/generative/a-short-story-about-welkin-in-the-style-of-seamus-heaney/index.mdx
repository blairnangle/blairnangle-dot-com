***Write a short story about welkin in the style of Seamus Heaney***

The sky was a welkin of grey,
A vast expanse of cloud and mist,
A blanket of fog that hung low,
A heavy shroud of grey.

The sun was hidden,
The stars were blocked,
The moon was a distant memory,
The sky was a welkin of grey.

The birds were silent,
The wind was still,
The trees were motionless,
The sky was a welkin of grey.

The air was thick,
The ground was cold,
The sky was a welkin of grey,
A vast expanse of nothingness.

But then, a glimmer of light,
A spark of hope,
A ray of sunshine,
The sky was a welkin of blue.

The birds sang,
The wind blew,
The trees swayed,
The sky was a welkin of blue.

The sun shone,
The stars twinkled,
The moon glowed,
The sky was a welkin of blue.

The air was fresh,
The ground was warm,
The sky was a welkin of blue,
A vast expanse of possibility.
