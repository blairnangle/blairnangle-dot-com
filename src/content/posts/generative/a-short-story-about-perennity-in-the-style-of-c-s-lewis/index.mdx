***Write a short story about perennity in the style of C. S. Lewis***

Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who had a deep longing for something more than the fleeting moments of life. He wanted something that would last forever, something that would never fade away.

One day, John was walking through a forest and he came across a mysterious old man. The old man had a kind face and a gentle voice, and he told John that he could show him the way to perennity.

John was intrigued and followed the old man through the forest. They eventually came to a clearing where the old man pointed to a large tree. He told John that this tree was the Tree of Perennity, and that if he touched it, he would be granted eternal life.

John was hesitant, but the old man assured him that it was safe and that he would never regret it. So, John reached out and touched the tree.

Immediately, he felt a warmth and peace wash over him. He felt as if he had been granted a new life, one that would never end. He thanked the old man and continued on his journey, feeling a newfound sense of peace and contentment.

John had found the secret to perennity, and he was determined to make the most of it. He lived a long and happy life, and when he eventually passed away, he did so knowing that he had found something that would last forever.
