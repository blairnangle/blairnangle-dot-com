***Write a short story about dorlach in the style of Seamus Heaney***

Dorlach's journey began at the edge of the great forest, where the mossy ground gave way to a wild and untamed land, filled with strange creatures, unknown plant life, and a multitude of mysteries. He had been summoned there by an old man, clad all in white, who had promised him an experience of a lifetime, and Dorlach, who had grown weary of the ordinary, was more than ready to embark on this strange and magical adventure.

The old man vanished as soon as they reached the forest, leaving Dorlach to wander through the trees, guided only by the soft music of the birdsong and the whisper of the breeze. He followed a path of sun-dappled beams, dodging shadow-drenched branches, ever in pursuit of something that seemed as elusive as his own soul.

For days, it seemed, Dorlach's journey went on; he was never certain if he was coming closer to or farther from his destination, but he still kept going, his feet aching but his heart ever-determined. He found strength in the sights and sounds of the forest, and its secrets comforted him.

At last, Dorlach reached the edge of a clearing and saw a shimmering pool of water, with a single rock jutting up from its center. Perched atop the rock, with his silk robes billowing around him, was the old man, his face radiant with wisdom and compassion.

The old man smiled at Dorlach and said softly, “This is where I have brought you—the sacred place of the Dorlach. Find peace here, and let your spirit be restored.”

Dorlach walked to the edge of the pool, and let the peacefulness of the place wash over him. He felt his heart slow, his worries ease away, and his soul rejuvenated. He closed his eyes, and allowed the beauty of the forest to embrace him.

When Dorlach opened his eyes again, the old man was gone. But Dorlach lingered for a time, feeling as if he was surrounded by a new and wondrous energy, for he had found his true purpose in the sacred place of the Dorlach.
