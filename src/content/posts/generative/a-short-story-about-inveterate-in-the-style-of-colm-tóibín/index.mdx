***Write a short story about inveterate in the style of Colm Tóibín***

It was a cold, grey morning when the old man awoke. He had been living in the same small cottage for over fifty years, and his life had been one of routine and monotony. Every morning he would rise early and take a walk in the woods, and every evening he would sit in his chair by the fire and read a book.

The old man was an inveterate, a person who was stubbornly and unyieldingly devoted to a habit or pursuit. In his case, it was reading. He had read every book in the small village library many times over, but he still kept coming back for more.

One day, while walking in the woods, the old man stumbled upon a small, hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing was a large, ancient tree, and the old man was drawn to it. He felt a strange energy emanating from the tree, and he was compelled to approach it.

When he got close, he noticed something strange. There were words carved into the trunk of the tree. He read them aloud and was astonished to find that they were words of wisdom, words that spoke to him and gave him comfort.

The old man returned to the tree every day, and each time he read the words, he felt a little bit more at peace. He felt like he had found a place where he could be himself, and he was no longer lonely.

The old man had become an inveterate, not just of reading, but of visiting the tree. He would go there every day, and the words of wisdom he found there kept him going. He was no longer alone, and he had found a place to call his own.
