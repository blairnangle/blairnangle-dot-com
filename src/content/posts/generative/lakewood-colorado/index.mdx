***Write a downbeat blog post about Lakewood, Colorado in complete sentences***

Lakewood, Colorado is a city that has seen better days. Once a thriving community, it has become a shadow of its former self. The economy has been in decline for years, and the city has been unable to attract new businesses or investment. The crime rate is high, and the streets are often filled with litter and graffiti. The schools are underfunded, and the infrastructure is crumbling. It's a sad state of affairs, and it's hard to see a bright future for Lakewood.
