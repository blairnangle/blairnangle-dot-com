Oldham is a town in Greater Manchester, England, on the River Irk, 5 miles (8 km) south-southeast of Rochdale, and 6 miles (9 km) northeast of Manchester. It is the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, which had a population of 230,800 in 2015.

Historically in Lancashire, and with little early history to speak of, Oldham rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and among the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming "one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England", spinning Oldham's fortunes. The town's textile manufacturing boom occurred in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, its peak being between 1840 and 1870, when Oldham had more spindles in operation than any other place in the world.

At its zenith, there were over 360 mills in Oldham, many of them powered by the River Irk and its tributaries. The first mill was built in 1798, and by 1804 there were eleven mills in operation. The town became known as "Oldham Cottonopolis" during this period. The concentration of textile mills in the town led to a rapid increase in population, from 5,000 in 1801 to over 60,000 by 1861. Many of the workers in the mills were young women and girls, known as "mill girls".

Oldham's boom as a centre of the textile industry was short-lived, however. The industry began to decline in the late 19th century, due to a combination of factors including foreign competition, the effects of the American Civil War on the supply of cotton, and a general move away from the use of cotton as a textile fibre. By the early 20th century, the town's textile industry had all but disappeared, and Oldham had become a "shadow of its former self".

The town's economy did not recover until the 1970s, when it began to benefit from the growth of the Greater Manchester conurbation. Oldham has since become a commuter town for Greater Manchester, and is also home to a number of light engineering and manufacturing businesses.
