***Write a short story about gloaming in the style of Oscar WildeW. B. Yeats***

once wrote, “Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild, With a faery, hand in hand, For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.”

It was a beautiful gloaming, the sun setting in the sky and the stars beginning to twinkle in the darkness. The air was still and the birds were singing their evening songs.

John and his wife, Mary, were walking hand in hand along the beach. They had been married for many years and were still very much in love. The sun was setting and the sky was turning a deep purple. The waves were lapping against the shore and the sand was cool beneath their feet.

As they walked, they talked about their lives and all the things they had done together. They reminisced about the good times and the bad, and laughed at the silly things they had done.

As the sun set and the stars began to twinkle, they stopped and looked out at the horizon. The sky was a deep, dark blue and the stars were shining brightly. It was a beautiful sight and they felt a sense of peace and contentment.

They stayed there for a while, just enjoying the moment and each other’s company. They were both filled with a deep appreciation for the beauty of the world and the preciousness of life.

Finally, they turned and started to walk back home. As they did, they both felt a deep sense of gratitude for the life they had been given and the love they shared.

The gloaming had been a magical experience and one they would never forget.
