***Write a short story about kymograph in the style of Seamus Heaney***

Kymograph, a machine of science,
A tool of precision and of consequence.
A device of such complexity,
It could measure the most subtle of intensity.

It was first invented by Carl Ludwig,
A German physiologist of renown.
He sought to measure the pulse of the heart,
And the kymograph was his art.

The machine was a marvel of its time,
Able to measure the most delicate of lines.
Its paper was inscribed with a pen,
A graph of the heart's beats and then.

The kymograph was used in many fields,
From physiology to engineering yields.
It could measure the force of a muscle,
Or the pressure of a valve's tussle.

The kymograph was a great invention,
A tool of science and of invention.
It could measure the most subtle of intensity,
And its legacy will live on in eternity.
