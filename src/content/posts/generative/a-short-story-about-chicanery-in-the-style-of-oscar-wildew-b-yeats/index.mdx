***Write a short story about chicanery in the style of Oscar WildeW. B. Yeats***

once said, "The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity." This quote could not have been more true for the story of the young man named Robert.

Robert had always been a kind and honest person, but he had a terrible habit of getting involved with the wrong kind of people. He had recently been befriended by a man named Thomas, who promised him a career in business. Robert was eager to take advantage of the opportunity, but he soon realized that Thomas was actually a master of chicanery.

Thomas had a way of using words and manipulation to get what he wanted. He would use Robert's naivety and gullibility to his advantage and take advantage of him. Thomas was able to convince Robert to invest in a business venture that was doomed to fail, and Robert lost all of his savings.

Robert was devastated and heartbroken. He had been taken advantage of by someone he thought he could trust. He felt betrayed and foolish for trusting someone so readily. He vowed to never again be so naive and gullible and to never let anyone take advantage of him again.

Robert learned an important lesson that day: never trust someone too quickly and always be aware of the possibility of chicanery. He realized that he should always be vigilant and never let his guard down. He also learned that it is better to be safe than sorry.
