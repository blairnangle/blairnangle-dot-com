***Write a short story about haverel in the style of Oscar WildeW. B. Yeats***

Havrel was a dashing young man, who had come of age in society by the time he was twenty. His tall and dark good looks had won him many admirers, both male and female, and his natural wit had made him a favorite amongst the elite. He was known for his keen sense of style and sophistication, and always managed to look impeccable no matter the occasion.

One day, a beautiful girl approached him at a party, hoping to make her mark on his heart. She introduced herself as Isadora, and was quite taken with the handsome Havrel. She found his manner delightful and his conversation intriguing, and she could not help but feel that he was someone she could open up to.

Something beautiful and passionate seemed to spark between the two of them, and soon enough, a formal courtship began. But as time went on, it became clear that Isadora wanted more from Havrel than he was ready to give. He remained polite and courteous, but there was something in his heart that kept him from fully committing to her.

Unknown to Isadora, Havrel had been deeply in love before and had had his heart broken. He was afraid of falling prey to his own desires once again, and so he held back from Isadora, remaining aloof and distant. She was growing increasingly frustrated, and soon enough, she disappeared from his life, leaving Havrel alone once again.

He was left to ponder over his life and choices, and it was at this point that W. B. Yeats's words resonated within him:

"Tread softly, because you tread on my dreams."

Havrel had been too afraid of his own dreams, and so he had denied himself the chance of love and missed out on something truly beautiful. He would never forget the lessons learned, and he vowed to never let fear take over his heart again.
