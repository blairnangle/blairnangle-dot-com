***Write a short story about sardonic in the style of Colm Tóibín***

The sun was setting on a small town in the south of Ireland. The sky was a deep orange, and the air was still and quiet.

In the center of town, a small cafe was bustling with activity. Inside, a group of locals were gathered around a table, talking and laughing. At the head of the table was a man with a sardonic smile on his face. He was a tall, thin man with a sharp wit and a dry sense of humor.

The man was known around town as "Sardonic". He was a bit of an outsider, but he was well-liked by the locals. He had a way of making people laugh, even when they didn't want to.

Sardonic had a way of looking at the world that was both humorous and cynical. He was always ready with a joke or a sarcastic comment, and he was never afraid to speak his mind.

The locals enjoyed his company, and they often gathered around his table to listen to his stories and jokes. He was a master storyteller, and he could make even the most mundane events seem interesting.

As the sun set, the locals said their goodbyes and went their separate ways. But Sardonic stayed behind, sipping his coffee and watching the sky turn from orange to purple. He had a feeling that something was about to change, and he wanted to be ready for it.

He knew that life was full of surprises, and he was determined to make the most of them. He was ready for whatever the future held, and he was sure that it would be full of laughter and joy.
