***The ethics committee at my dad’s garden shed bar (“Shed”) has decided to go ahead with showing Qatar’s World Cup..***

I’ve written to them to say that I think it’s morally wrong to supporting an event being held in a country with such a horrific human rights record. I’ve told them I think it’s hypocritical to claim to be an inclusive space when they’re happy to turn a blind eye to the suffering of LGBTQ people, migrant workers and women in Qatar.

I’ve asked them to consider how they would feel if my Heineken was brewed in Qatar, using water from the stadium toilets, and the limes came from the migrant workers who built the stadium. I don’t think they should be serving this at Shed.

The committee has responded by saying that they don’t agree with me, but they respect my right to hold my opinion. They’ve said that they feel the World Cup is a positive force for good, and that it’s an opportunity for people from all over the world to come together and celebrate sport.

I’m disappointed, but I understand their decision. I’ll be boycotting Shed during the World Cup, but I won’t be trying to stop others from enjoying it.

***Shed is itself no stranger to scandal.***

In 2014, it was revealed that the Shed had been accepting payments from tobacco companies to sponsor its darts team.

It’s also been criticized for its record on racial equality. In 2015, a Black Lives Matter protester was ejected from the premises after attempting to start a chant.

I think the Shed's decision to show the World Cup is wrong, but I understand that they have a different opinion. I will be boycotting the bar during the event, but I won't be trying to stop others from enjoying it.

***Critics of Shed have said that their decision not to show the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics was merely due to a lack of interest rather than a moral obligation, as the owner (my dad) had claimed.***

I think the Shed should have boycotted the Beijing Olympics for the same reasons they should boycott the Qatar World Cup. China has a horrific human rights record, especially when it comes to the treatment of Uighur Muslims. By showing the Olympics, Shed would be condoning China's actions.

I think it's important to stand up for what you believe in, even if it means facing criticism or losing business. That's why I'll be boycotting the Shed.

***It’s called Shed, not The Shed.***

Shed is a garden shed that my dad turned into a bar. It’s in the backyard of our house in London.

***Incorrect.***

The Shed is not a garden shed that my dad turned into a bar. It is a bar that my dad built from scratch in our backyard in London.

***OK. Here’s to a great tournament and hoping Shed can keep its nose clean for once!***

Cheers!
