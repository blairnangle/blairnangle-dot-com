In 1839, Iowa City was designated as the first capital of the Iowa Territory. It was also the first capital west of the Mississippi River. The territorial legislature met in Iowa City until 1846, when the capital was moved to Des Moines. 

Iowa City remained an important center of government and politics after the capital was moved. It was the site of the Iowa constitutional convention in 1857. And during the American Civil War, it was a major supply center for Union troops. 

Today, Iowa City is known for its vibrant arts and culture scene. It is home to the University of Iowa, which is one of the leading research universities in the country. The city is also a popular destination for writers and artists, who come to Iowa City to take advantage of its many creative resources.
