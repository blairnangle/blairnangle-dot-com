***Write a short story about noetic in the style of Lady Gregory***

Once upon a time, in a far away land, there lived a wise and powerful wizard named Noetic. He was renowned for his magical powers and his ability to solve any problem.

Noetic was a kind and generous man, and he used his powers to help those in need. He was often called upon to help the poor and the sick, and he never refused a request for help.

One day, a young woman named Eliza came to Noetic seeking his help. She had been cursed by a powerful witch and was in desperate need of a cure. Noetic listened to her story and agreed to help her.

He used his magical powers to create a potion that would break the curse. He instructed Eliza to drink the potion and she was immediately cured.

Noetic was so pleased with the results that he decided to share his magical powers with the world. He created a school of magic and invited students from all over the world to come and learn.

Noetic's school quickly became renowned for its magical teachings and students flocked to it from all corners of the globe. Noetic's students learned the secrets of the magical arts and soon became powerful wizards in their own right.

Noetic's legacy lives on to this day. His teachings are still studied and practiced by many, and his magical powers are still sought after by those in need. Noetic's wisdom and generosity will never be forgotten.
