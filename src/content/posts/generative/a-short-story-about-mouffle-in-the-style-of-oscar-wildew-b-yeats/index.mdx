***Write a short story about mouffle in the style of Oscar WildeW. B. Yeats***

once said, "Mouffle is the most beautiful thing in the world".

Mouffle was a small but graceful creature who lived in a magical forest. Its coat was a soft, silvery-gray, and its eyes were a deep, vibrant blue. Its fur was so soft and luxurious that it seemed to have a life of its own.

Mouffle was a solitary creature. It spent its days wandering through the forest, exploring its surroundings and enjoying the peace and quiet. It rarely interacted with other creatures and preferred to keep to itself.

One day, however, Mouffle encountered a human. The human was tall and handsome, and Mouffle was immediately drawn to him. For the first time, Mouffle felt a longing to be with another being.

The human saw Mouffle and was impressed by its beauty. He offered Mouffle a handful of wildflowers, which the creature accepted with pleasure.

The human spent hours talking with Mouffle, telling it stories and listening to its own. Eventually, the human grew to love the creature, and he asked if it would be his companion.

Mouffle was delighted and agreed to the request. From then on, the two were inseparable. They spent their days exploring the forest and playing games together.

Mouffle's beauty was admired by all who saw it, and it soon became the most beloved creature in the forest. The human and Mouffle lived happily ever after, enjoying each other's company and the beauty of the forest together.
