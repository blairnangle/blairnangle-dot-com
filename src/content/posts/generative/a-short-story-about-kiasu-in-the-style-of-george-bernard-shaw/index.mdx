***Write a short story about kiasu in the style of George Bernard Shaw***

Once upon a time, in a kingdom far far away, there lived a young girl named Kiasu. As the daughter of a wealthy benefactor, Kiasu was used to having her every desire met without question. But while she was accustomed to privilege and the spoils of status, what Kiasu sought after was something more meaningful.

Where Kiasu's peers were content to do the least required to succeed, she was determined to do more. No matter the task at hand, Kiasu strove for success, parsing through details meticulously. To Kiasu, conquering a new challenge became both an itch and a drug. Whether it was setting a new high score in a game, receiving top marks in a quiz, or winning a verbal debate, Kiasu was adamant about never being second place.

This tenacity made Kiasu the thing of legend among many of her peers, who worried that her superior devotion to accomplishment would somehow leave them behind in her shadow. Nevertheless, Kiasu did not apologize for her ambition, though she frequently distanced herself from others as a result of her singular focus. It was only when Kiasu encountered a problem that couldn't be solved through effort alone that she finally sought outside help and formed genuine connections with her peers.

Throughout her journey of self-discovery, Kiasu discovered the true reward of hard work, that no amount of money or privilege could ever compare to the feeling of achievement and camaraderie earned by tackling a challenge together. In the end, Kiasu found the balance she sought, able to embrace her kiasu propensity without sacrificing her close relationships.

And Kiasu lived happily ever after.
