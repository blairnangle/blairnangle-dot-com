***Write a short story about rigolette in the style of Seamus Heaney***

Rigolette was a young girl with a wild imagination. She lived in a small village in the countryside, surrounded by rolling hills and lush green fields. She loved the natural beauty of her home, and often spent her days wandering the countryside, playing in the streams and exploring the woods.

One summer's day, Rigolette was walking along a path in the woods when she heard a strange sound coming from the trees. It was a beautiful, tinkling melody, almost like a song. She looked up and saw a small, winged creature perched on a branch. It was a sprite, a magical creature of Irish folklore.

The sprite smiled at Rigolette and beckoned her closer. She was enchanted by the beauty of the creature and stepped closer, mesmerized. The sprite began to play a tune on a small, silver flute. The music filled the air, and Rigolette was entranced.

The sprite told her that he was called Rigolette, and that he was here to teach her a special game. He explained that the game was called rigolette, and that it was a type of tag. Rigolette was to chase the sprite around the woods, and if she caught him, she was to give him a kiss.

Rigolette was delighted and agreed to the game. They played for hours, chasing each other around the trees, laughing and giggling. As the sun set, Rigolette finally caught the sprite and gave him a kiss on the cheek.

As the sprite flew away, Rigolette felt a magical spark, and she knew that she would never forget the day she had spent playing rigolette with a magical sprite.
