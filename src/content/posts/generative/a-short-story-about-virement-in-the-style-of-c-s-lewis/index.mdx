***write a short story about virement in the style of C. S. Lewis***

Once upon a time, there lived a young man named Virement who was a master of the magical art of virement. He had been born with the ability to move money from one account to another with a simple wave of his hand.

Virement was a kind and generous soul, and he used his gift to help those in need. He would often transfer money from his own account to those of the less fortunate, and he was always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

One day, Virement was approached by a mysterious stranger who asked him to perform a special task. The stranger wanted Virement to transfer a large sum of money from one account to another. Virement was hesitant at first, but the stranger assured him that the money would be used for a good cause.

Virement agreed, and with a wave of his hand, he transferred the money from one account to another. The stranger thanked Virement and disappeared into the night.

The next day, Virement was surprised to find that the money had been used to help those in need. He was amazed at the power of his gift and vowed to use it to help others whenever he could.

From that day forward, Virement used his gift of virement to help those in need. He was a true hero, and his generosity was known far and wide. He was an inspiration to all who knew him, and his legacy of kindness and generosity lives on to this day.
