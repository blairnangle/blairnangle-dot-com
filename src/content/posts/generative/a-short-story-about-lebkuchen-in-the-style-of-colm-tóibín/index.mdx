***Write a short story about lebkuchen in the style of Colm Tóibín***

It was the time of year for lebkuchen, the delicious traditional German cookie. Every year, the streets of the small town of Düsseldorf were filled with the wonderful scent of freshly baked lebkuchen.

It was a time of joy and celebration for the people of Düsseldorf. The smell of the sweet cookies wafted through the air and the townspeople could not wait to get their hands on them.

The town baker, Anna, had been baking lebkuchen for years. She was a master of the craft and her cookies were renowned throughout the region. Every year, she made sure to set aside a special batch of lebkuchen just for her family.

This year, Anna's daughter, Greta, was particularly excited. Every year, she would help her mother bake the cookies and this year was no different. She eagerly anticipated the day when the cookies were finished and she could finally eat them.

On the day of the big bake, Greta was in the kitchen with her mother, helping her to mix the ingredients and shape the dough into perfect circles. Finally, when the cookies were ready, Anna took them out of the oven and placed them on a plate. Greta grabbed a cookie and eagerly bit into it. The flavor was heavenly.

She couldn't help but smile as she savored the sweet taste of the lebkuchen. Every year, she looked forward to this time of year and the delicious treats it brought.

The people of Düsseldorf would celebrate the joyous season of lebkuchen for many years to come.
